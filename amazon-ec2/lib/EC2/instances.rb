    # The RunInstances operation launches a specified number of instances. 
    # 
    # Note : The Query version of RunInstances only allows instances of a single AMI to be launched in 
    # one call. This is different from the SOAP API call of the same name but similar to the 
    # ec2-run-instances command line tool. 
    # 
    # A call to RunInstances is guaranteed to start no fewer than the requested minimum. If there is 
    # insufficient capacity available then no instances will be started. Amazon EC2 will make a best effort 
    # attempt to satisfy the requested maximum values. 
    # 
    # Every instance is launched in a security group. This may be specified as part of the launch request. If a 
    # security group is not indicated then instances are started in a the default security group. 
    # An optional keypair ID may be provided for each image in the launch request. All instances that are 
    # created from images for which this is provided will have access to the associated public key at boot time 
    # (detailed below). This key may be used to provide secure access to an instance of an image on a 
    # per-instance basis. Amazon EC2 public images make use of this functionality to provide secure 
    # passwordless access to instances (and launching those images without a keypair ID will leave them 
    # inaccessible). 
    # 
    # The public key material is made available to the instance at boot time by placing it in a file named 
    # openssh_id.pub on a logical device that is exposed to the instance as /dev/sda2 (the ephemeral 
    # store). The format of this file is suitable for use as an entry within ~/.ssh/authorized_keys (the 
    # OpenSSH format). This can be done at boot time (as part of rclocal, for example) allowing for secure 
    # password-less access. As the need arises, other formats will also be considered.

    # making the request.

    # instance IDs are provided, information of all relevant instances information will be returned. If an 
    # instance is specified that does not exist a fault is returned. If an instance is specified that exists but is not 
    # owned by the user making the request, then that instance will not be included in the returned results.

    # their termination. This interval is typically of the order of one hour
