    # The RunInstances operation launches a specified number of instances.
    #
    # Note:
    #   The Query version of RunInstances only allows instances of a 
    #   single AMI to be launched in one call. This is different 
    #   from the SOAP API call of the same name but similar to the 
    #   ec2-run-instances command line tool.
    # 
    # A call to RunInstances is guaranteed to start no fewer than the 
    # requested minimum. If there is insufficient capacity available 
    # then no instances will be started. Amazon EC2 will make a best 
    # effort attempt to satisfy the requested maximum values.
    #
    # Every instance is launched in a security group. This may be 
    # specified as part of the launch request. If a security group is 
    # not indicated then instances are started in a the default security group.
    #
    # An optional keypair ID may be provided for each image in the launch 
    # request. All instances that are created from images for which this 
    # is provided will have access to the associated public key at boot 
    # time (detailed below). This key may be used to provide secure access 
    # to an instance of an image on a per-instance basis. Amazon EC2 public 
    # images make use of this functionality to provide secure passwordless 
    # access to instances (and launching those images without a keypair ID 
    # will leave them inaccessible).
    #
    # The public key material is made available to the instance at boot 
    # time by placing it in a file named openssh_id.pub on a logical 
    # device that is exposed to the instance as /dev/sda2 (the ephemeral store). 
    # The format of this file is suitable for use as an entry within 
    # ~/.ssh/authorized_keys (the OpenSSH format). This can be done at boot 
    # time (as part of rclocal, for example) allowing for secure 
    # password-less access. As the need arises, other formats will 
    # also be considered.
