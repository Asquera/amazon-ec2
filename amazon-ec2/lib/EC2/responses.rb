module EC2
  
  # There are two major types of responses that can come back from EC2#method calls:
  #
  # * A 'Set' Array which is a collection of objects
  # * A 'Response' object (Response or Subclasses) which encapsulates data returned 
  #   as a result of running the method.  In this case the object is an OpenStruct 
  #   and is Enumerable so you can iterate over all of the data returned.
  # * Note regarding Boolean responses.  Those EC2 methods that simply respond with a 
  #   'true' when called will return an empty sub-class of the Response object that
  #   matches the calling method.  The presence of this object (as opposed to an Exception)
  #   means that that method call succeeded.
  #
 
  # The make_request() and ec2_error? methods, which are shared by all, will raise any 
  # exceptions encountered along the way as it converses with EC2.
  #
  # Exception Handling:  A call to any of these methods will respond with one of the
  # types mentioned above.  If for some reason an error occurrs when executing a method
  # (e.g. its arguments were incorrect, or it simply failed) then an exception will 
  # be thrown.  The exceptions are defined in exceptions.rb as individual classes and should
  # match the exceptions that Amazon has defined for EC2.  If the exception raised cannot be
  # identified then a more generic exception class will be thrown.
  #
  # The implication of this is that you need to be prepared to handle any exceptions that
  # may be raised by this library in YOUR code with 'rescue' clauses.  It is up to you
  # how gracefully you want to handle these exceptions that are raised.
  
  
  # The superclass for all general responses.  A Set (or one of its sub-classes)
  # may return an Array of these objects.
  #
  # I learned the magic of making an OpenStruct object able to respond as a fully Enumerable 
  # object (responds to .each, etc.) thanks to a great blog article on Struct and OpenStruct 
  # at http://errtheblog.com/post/30

  # just using these objects to collect up other responses (e.g. a collection of Images)
  class Set < Array

  # Sub-Classes Of 'Response'
  # These are the responses that we need to define as they will be filled with data
  # that needs to be encapsulated (rather than a simple boolean).
