=CHANGELOG.txt : Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) Ruby Gem

===0.0.3 (12/16/2006)
* API CHANGE : Changed method name 'authorize' to 'authorize_security_group_ingress' to ensure consistent 
  naming of Ruby library methods to match AWS EC2 API actions. Alias to 'authorize' for backwards compatibility.
* API CHANGE : Changed method name 'revoke' to 'revoke_security_group_ingress' to ensure consistent 
	naming of Ruby library methods to match AWS EC2 API actions. Alias to 'revoke' for backwards compatibility.
* API CHANGE : Changed method name 'delete_securitygroup' to 'delete_security_group' to ensure consistent 
	naming of Ruby library methods to match AWS EC2 API actions. Alias to 'delete_securitygroup' for backwards compatibility.
* API CHANGE : Changed method name 'describe_securitygroups' to 'describe_security_group' to ensure consistent 
	naming of Ruby library methods to match AWS EC2 API actions. Alias to 'describe_securitygroups' for backwards compatibility.
* API CHANGE : Changed method name 'create_securitygroup' to 'create_security_group' to ensure consistent 
	naming of Ruby library methods to match AWS EC2 API actions. Alias to 'create_securitygroup' for backwards compatibility.
* Added many API rdoc's, some method descriptions copied from Amazon Query API Developer Guide.
* Extracted some parts of the formerly monolithic EC2 library out into separate files for manageability.
* Changed the HTTP 'User-Agent' string used for each request so that we have our own user agent
  to identify this library's calls.  Now set the version # in the user agent string based on the
  master version number for this library which is stored in lib/EC2/version.rb and should only
  be defined in one place.
* Set @http.verify_mode = OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_NONE to avoid seeing SSL Cert warning 
  "warning: peer certificate won't be verified in this SSL session". File EC2.rb:96
* Make 'pathlist' utility method a private method (EC2.rb:111).  No reason I can see for this to be exposed.

===0.0.2 (12/14/2006)
* Bugfix in run_instances method.  Method works now.  Patch submitted by Stephen Caudill on AWS forums.  Thanks!

===0.0.1 (12/13/2006)
* Initial release of the Ruby Gem.  This includes the version of the library exactly as provided by 
  Amazon Web Services as example code.  No changes or enhancements to that code were made other than 
  packaging it as a Ruby Gem.
* RubyForge project created.  http://amazon-ec2.rubyforge.org
